## Introduction to CNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model commonly used for analyzing visual data. CNNs are particularly effective for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.

## Core Components of CNNs

CNNs are composed of several key components:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Apply filters to the input image to detect features.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity (e.g., ReLU).
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform high-level reasoning for classification/detection.

## CNN Implementation from Scratch using Python and NumPy

We implement a simple CNN from scratch using Python and NumPy to illustrate how convolution, pooling, and activation functions work.

## Building CNNs with TensorFlow and PyTorch

We then build more sophisticated CNNs using TensorFlow and PyTorch to demonstrate the ease of using these frameworks.

## Visualizing Feature Maps

Visualizing feature maps helps us understand how the CNN "sees" and learns from the input data.

## Conclusion

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of CNNs, their architecture, and how to implement them both from scratch and with popular deep learning libraries.
